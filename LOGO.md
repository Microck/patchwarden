## Color Palette — "Spectra Guard"

A palette inspired by security terminals, radar screens, and the green/black aesthetic of classic security monitors — elevated for modern brand identity.

| Role | Color | Hex | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Primary | Ink | `#0d1117` | Deep authority, night watch, terminal black |
| Secondary | Mint Beam | `#00d9a5` | Active scanning, clean detection, "all clear" signal |
| Accent | Ember | `#ff6b35` | Threat flagged, warning, attention-grabbing |
| Neutral | Slate | `#30363d` | Technical backbone, dark mode compatible |

**Why this palette works:**
- **Ink + Mint Beam** = High contrast terminal aesthetic (think: radar, scan lines)
- **Ember accent** = Instant threat recognition without being aggressive red
- **Distinctive** = Not the typical blue/gray tech palette
- **Memorable** = High-energy mint against deep ink creates strong brand recall

## Design Rationale

**Why "Spectra Guard" palette over alternatives:**

1. **vs. Generic Tech Blue**: Mint/ink is more memorable and says "detection" vs "just another tool"
2. **vs. Aggressive Red**: Ember is warning without panic; trust remains primary
3. **vs. Pure Monochrome**: Mint accent adds energy and modernity
4. **vs. Gaming Neons**: Professional enough for security context, unique enough to stand out

**Semantic color mapping:**
- Ink = Authority, depth, protection
- Mint = Active scanning, clean results, safety
- Ember = Threat detected, attention needed
- Slate = Neutral technical foundation
