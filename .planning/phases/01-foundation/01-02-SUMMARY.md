# Phase 1 Plan 2: Upload Pipeline Summary

**Shipped a full upload ingestion path with backend abstraction, safe local persistence, and optional Azure Blob support without breaking local development.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-15T19:23:05Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-15T19:26:36Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 8

## Accomplishments

- Added `StorageBackend` contract plus traversal-safe local storage implementation.
- Added env-gated Azure Blob adapter that only requires SDK/credentials when instantiated.
- Implemented `POST /upload` with extension checks, max-size guardrails, and persistence tests.

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Storage interface + local implementation (default)** - `7c5ab59` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Azure Blob storage adapter (optional, env-gated)** - `948b573` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Upload API route + tests** - `6b138b7` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `.env.example` - local/azure storage defaults and placeholders
- `src/jarspect/storage/base.py` - storage contract and key normalization
- `src/jarspect/storage/local.py` - local byte persistence with traversal protection
- `src/jarspect/storage/azure_blob.py` - lazy Azure Blob adapter
- `src/jarspect/api/routes/upload.py` - multipart upload endpoint
- `tests/test_upload.py` - upload success and validation coverage

## Decisions Made

- Kept Azure SDK optional by importing inside adapter constructor.
- Used chunked file reads in upload route to enforce max size before write.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

- None.

## User Setup Required

None - local mode is default and fully functional without external configuration.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Upload IDs and stored jar bytes are available for intake scanning.
- No blockers for `01-03-PLAN.md`.

## Self-Check: PASSED

- `.planning/phases/01-foundation/01-02-SUMMARY.md` exists.
- Commits `7c5ab59`, `948b573`, and `6b138b7` exist in git log.
