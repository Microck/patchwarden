# Phase 2 Plan 2: Pattern Engine Summary

**Built a deterministic static detection engine with a 10+ rule catalog and typed findings output suitable for API and verdict consumption.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-15T19:33:04Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-15T19:36:10Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 6

## Accomplishments

- Defined 11 suspicious patterns across obfuscation, network, file I/O, reflection, and process execution.
- Implemented matcher that emits per-file indicators with evidence excerpts.
- Added static findings models with category/severity rollups for API consumption.

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Define suspicious pattern catalog (10+ rules)** - `dae16c0` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Pattern matcher + result model + tests** - `fc6be29` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/jarspect/analysis/patterns.py` - rule catalog with stable IDs and rationale
- `src/jarspect/analysis/static_scan.py` - deterministic matcher and snippet extraction
- `src/jarspect/models/static.py` - typed static indicator and findings models
- `tests/test_patterns.py` - catalog size and multi-category detection tests

## Decisions Made

- Kept severity levels as `low/med/high` in static stage for straightforward score weighting later.
- Ensured matcher output includes evidence text to support explainable verdict narratives.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

- None.

## User Setup Required

None.

## Next Phase Readiness

- StaticAgent can now consume this matcher and signature layer in `02-04`.
- No blockers for remaining static-analysis plans.

## Self-Check: PASSED

- `.planning/phases/02-static-analysis/02-02-SUMMARY.md` exists.
- Commits `dae16c0` and `fc6be29` exist in git log.
