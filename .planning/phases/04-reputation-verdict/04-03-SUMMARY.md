# Phase 4 Plan 3: Full Scan Persistence Summary

**Completed a unified scan pipeline with persisted scan records and retrieval APIs so end-to-end verdicts are now addressable by `scan_id`.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 5 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-15T20:27:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-15T20:31:33Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 13

## Accomplishments

- Added `run_scan` pipeline orchestration that executes intake, static, behavior, optional reputation, and verdict synthesis.
- Added `ScanStore` with in-memory cache plus optional JSON persistence under `.local-data/scans/` (default enabled).
- Updated `POST /scan` to return `{scan_id, result}` and store the result.
- Added `GET /scans/{scan_id}` for persisted scan retrieval and full API-level flow coverage.

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Build scan pipeline + persistence store** - `4e58039` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Update /scan to return scan_id and add GET /scans/{scan_id}** - `0d905c2` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/jarspect/pipeline/scan_pipeline.py` - orchestrated scan runner with verdict generation.
- `src/jarspect/store/scans.py` - persisted scan storage and retrieval implementation.
- `src/jarspect/store/__init__.py` - scan store accessor and cache.
- `src/jarspect/models/scan.py` - scan response envelope and verdict field.
- `src/jarspect/api/routes/scan.py` - write path with scan persistence.
- `src/jarspect/api/routes/scans.py` - read path by scan id.
- `src/jarspect/api/main.py` - route registration for `/scans/{scan_id}`.
- `tests/test_scan_full.py` - upload -> scan -> get-by-id integration coverage.

## Decisions Made

- Chose default-on local JSON persistence to keep scans retrievable after process restarts.
- Introduced scan envelope `{scan_id, result}` to simplify UI workflows and API consistency.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Updated existing scan API tests for response envelope migration**
- **Found during:** Task 2 (scan endpoint response contract update)
- **Issue:** Existing tests expected legacy flat `/scan` payload (`intake/static/behavior` at top level), causing failures after introducing `{scan_id, result}`.
- **Fix:** Updated existing scan-related tests to read the new envelope and assert `scan_id` presence.
- **Files modified:** tests/test_scan_static.py, tests/test_scan_behavior.py, tests/test_intake.py, tests/test_reputation.py
- **Verification:** `python3 -m pytest -q`
- **Committed in:** `0d905c2`

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (1 blocking)
**Impact on plan:** Response contract migration remained within scope and all API tests now validate the new behavior.

## Issues Encountered

- None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- End-to-end scan API and retrieval path are ready for web UI wiring and demo scripts in Phase 5.

## Self-Check: PASSED

- `.planning/phases/04-reputation-verdict/04-03-SUMMARY.md` exists.
- Commits `4e58039` and `0d905c2` exist in git log.
