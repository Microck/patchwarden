## Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-15 | Use fixture-backed reputation scoring for MVP | Deterministic demo behavior without external API dependencies |
| 2026-02-15 | Keep verdict synthesis deterministic (no LLM) | Stable and testable risk scoring for demo reliability |
| 2026-02-15 | Standardize scan API response as `{scan_id, result}` | Enables persisted retrieval and clean UI/demo integration |
| 2026-02-15 | Ship synthetic suspicious sample instead of real malware | Demo safety and policy-friendly submission artifacts |
| 2026-02-15 | Treat demo video recording as non-blocking manual follow-up | Full automation cannot produce polished narrated MP4 artifact |

---

## Blockers / Concerns

- Non-blocking follow-up: record and export final demo video to `demo/video.mp4`.
